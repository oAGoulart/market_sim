A simple class assignment I made during my CS undergrad at unipampa.

This assignment consists of modeling and implementing a simulation (not real time) of cashier service in a supermarket using data structures such as queues and lists.

The code in this repository was made for educational purposes only, you may use it for fun or to help with your own assignments but I do not recommend it for production use.
